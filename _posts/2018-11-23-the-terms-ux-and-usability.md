    <span class="dropcap">A</span> explanation of the terms and concepts of user experience & usability.
</p>

It is important to understand that these two terms are not synonyms and they should be used specificly in the right context.
Basically _user experience_ (also named UX) is the whole end-to-end experience which is a consequence of brand image, presentation, functionality, 
system performance, interactive behaviour, and assistive capabilities of a product. 
It also takes into account what happens before (expectations) and after (fulfilment of expectations) a product is used. 
Focusing solely on usability is quite a common mistake.

The following figure shows the relationship between **user experience** and **usability**:

#### Expectations / Anticipated use

Before a user is using a product - he has expectations.
These are influenced by:

* Company branding / Marketing
* Customer reviews
* Previous interactions (with other products and services)
* ...

#### Usability / Actual Use

Officially _usability_ is defined as:

> The extent to which an interactive system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with **effectiveness**, **efficiency** and **satisfaction** in a specified context of use.

This means _usability_ is mainly about the interaction with a product.
It is possible with specific techniques (e.g. usability tests) to evaluate and measure the usability aspects.
With the results we should continuously (iterative) increase the overall value and UX of a product.

#### Fulfilment of expectations / After Use

After a product is used we automatically think about our expectations that we had.
Did we got what we expected? When yes, we are normally positive about the product and had a good user experienece.
This could be influenced by:

* Product delivery
* Post-sales support
* Recent interactions (e.g. product support)
* ...

Hopefully this helps to understand the relationship between the terms **user experience** and **usability**.
