### .NET Conf 2019 is right ahead

I'm excited and overwhelmed by the [agenda](https://www.dotnetconf.net/agenda) topic list and [speaker](https://www.dotnetconf.net/speakers) line-up of the .NET Conf 2019.
I also deeply respect the involvement of the community by the organizers and the effort spent by the community speakers to bring it on - well done!

It's definitely worth attending a [.NET Conf 2019 local event](https://www.dotnetconf.net/local-events) to get together with other .NET friends.
Join me on the 30th september at [Community .NET Conf 2019 Event](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Basel-NET-User-Group/events/264124718/).
