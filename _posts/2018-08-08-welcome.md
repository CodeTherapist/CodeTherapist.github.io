<p class="intro">
<span class="dropcap">W</span>elcome!
</p>
I never really thought I would start a blog.
But the past years, I learned a lot from the developer community by reading their blog posts.

<a href="https://www.hanselman.com" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> inspired me because<a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx"  target="_blank"> he encourages every developer to have a blog</a> - and he has right!

A huge 'thank you' goes to <a href="https://asp.net-hacker.rocks/" target="_blank">JÃ¼rgen Gutsch</a>. He is organizing with me the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Basel-NET-User-Group/" target="_blank">.NET User Group Basel</a> and he helped me getting involved with community work.

Well, now it's my time to give back and share my knowledge with the community.
This blog is dedicated to improving the profession of software development, with a focus on skills and techniques.
